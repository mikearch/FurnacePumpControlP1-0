/*
 NOTES:
 This function requires a test in the main body for:
  a, temperature actual vs. temperature target
  b. Heating system mode

 
 This function is called only if:
  a. Heating System is AWAY ,and
  b. Temp Actual is Less than or Equal to LOW Temp, and

 The function then 
  a. records the start time of the function
  b. If the system is off, it records the ON time and turns the system ON
  c. It calculates the running time of the current ON cycle
  d. It determines wheter Hold time has been exceeded.
  It turns the system off
